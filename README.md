# Next.js App Router Dashboard Demo from Vercel

This dashboard is built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The starter template for this project is provided as part of the Next.js App Router Course. The template contains only the initial code for the dashboard application, and students will need to go through 16 chapters to fully complete it.

Upon completing this project, it will serve as a strong foundation for my career as a Next.js web developer, as I will have finished the official tutorial taught by Next.js' creator.

For more information, please refer to the [course curriculum](https://nextjs.org/learn) on the Next.js website.
